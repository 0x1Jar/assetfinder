# assetfinder

Find domains and subdomains potentially related to a given domain.


## Install

If you have Go installed and configured (i.e. with `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`):

```
go install github.com/0x1Jar/assetfinder@latest
```

Alternatively, you can [download a pre-compiled release for your platform](https://github.com/0x1Jar/assetfinder/releases).
To make it easier to execute you can put the binary in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

```
assetfinder [--subs-only] [--sources <source1,source2...>] <domain>
```

If `<domain>` is not provided, assetfinder will read domains from stdin (one domain per line).

**Flags:**
* `--subs-only`: Only include subdomains of the search domain.
* `--sources <source1,...,sourceN>`: Specify a comma-separated list of sources to use. If not provided, all available sources are used.
  Available sources: `crtsh`, `certspotter`, `hackertarget`, `threatcrowd`, `wayback`, `dns.bufferover.run`, `facebook`, `virustotal`, `findsubdomains`, `urlscan`.
